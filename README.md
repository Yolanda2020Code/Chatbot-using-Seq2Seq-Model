# Chatbot-using-Seq2Seq-Model
Building a chatbot using a Seq2Seq model typically involves using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers. This example provides a basic outline of building a chatbot with TensorFlow 2.x. For simplicity, the code structure here provides an elementary setup.

# Chatbot using Seq2Seq Model

This project aims to create a basic chatbot using the Seq2Seq model with TensorFlow 2.x. The provided example uses dummy data for demonstration purposes, but a real-world implementation would require a larger dataset and more preprocessing steps.

## Description:
- The model uses LSTM layers to create an encoder-decoder architecture.
- The encoder processes input sequences and returns its internal state.
- The decoder uses this state to produce the output sequence (response).

## Requirements:
- numpy
- tensorflow>=2.0

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
2. Replace the sample data with a more extensive dataset.
3. Train the model using the provided code.
4. Save and deploy your chatbot.

**Note**: This is a simple illustrative example, and for a fully functioning chatbot, more intricacies like attention mechanisms, data preprocessing, and tokenization would be required.
